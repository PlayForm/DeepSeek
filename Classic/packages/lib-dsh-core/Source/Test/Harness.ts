// Source/Test/Harness.ts - the shared test harness for the CORE unit tests.
// The core is a pure unit: NO fake ctx, NO factory - every test imports the
// REAL built Target/Library.js of its own bundle only, so the harness here is
// minimal: the Check counter (one Check per source-suite ok group; the
// callback carries that group's assertions byte-identical and in source
// order), the Finish guard, and the tmpdir fixture for the Policy folder.
//
// Standalone selfcheck: `node Target/Test/Harness.js --selfcheck` runs the
// counter through one deliberate pass + one deliberate failure and exits 0
// only when both are counted exactly (the negative control for the harness
// itself); prepublishOnly.sh gates the build on it. Imported as a library,
// this module only exports.
