/**
 * @module ESBuild
 *
 * Custom ESBuild configuration for the panel-family host package
 * (@playform/ets-client-dsh-panel-family-host), passed to `@playform/build` via
 * `--ESBuild Configuration/ESBuild.ts` (the twin-file convention, modeled on
 * the live-containers template). The base configuration from the build tool
 * already applies: `format: esm`, `platform: node`, `bundle: false` - each
 * Source file transpiles to its own Target file and imports stay external;
 * the type-only imports of `@deepseek-ai/cordis` are erased. The host reads
 * the `~/.dsh` logs through plain node:fs (read-only), so no runtime import
 * beyond node builtins exists.
 *
 * `minimize: true` is safe: every response string is a runtime-evaluated
 * line slice; no regex is built from source text; the service surface is
 * name/method based. The `define` block makes the build-time constants
 * explicit: the package's own name and version (read at config-load time)
 * compile into `process.env.NAME_PACKAGE` and `process.env.VERSION_PACKAGE`
 * rather than relying on the build tool's default define.
 *
 * The `Target` plugin (wipe `Target/` on start) is kept so stale files can
 * never linger after a rename or removal.
